The Project ITunesAPI is a Java based maven managed project.

There are two main test types Functional & performance tests embedded in this project.

The tests can be invoked from command line in multiple ways as shown below.
	mvn test -Dtest=api.test.GoRightsFunctionalTests#test_001_get_search_single_param
	mvn test -Dtest=api.test.PerfTests
	mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile smoke_suite_testng.xml

If we wish to avoid commits and do a quick tests from jenkins the framework supports to feed cmd line args to the tests. See sample below.
	mvn test -Dtest=api.test.GoRightsFunctionalTests#test_001_get_search_single_param -Dcmd_var1=love
